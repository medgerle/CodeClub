# Code Club

## Description
A club that meets weelky after school to learn basic coding skills to create anything from a simple website to an intricate game designed by you!
  - An afterschool program to address the lack of creative technological knowledge and skills. Knowing that high school students may not have at-home access to computers and/or internet, underpriveleged CPS students will have a safe space to learn and to create shareable products that will enhance their self-image and motivation.

### Features
1. Sign up: registers a student to participate in weekly meetings for either one semester or academic year
2. Networking: students are given the opportunity to work together with students from their school plus students and other professionals around the city
3. Create/Play: the end product of the club/program is something the students came up with on their own or created together that they can share and use

## Context
### Motivation
I decided to start this project for high school students in the Chicago area because of the lack of opportunity. I can use my privilege to their advantage so that they can learn the skills necessary to succeed in the world they will be entering once leaving school. Too often is education neglected and infrequently updated to suite the students' needs.

### How does it work?
A student hears an announcement introducing a new club/afterschool program, sees posters around school advertising, sees or is given sign up sheets and will choose a day and time for weekly meetings. Students and parents will be notified about an introductory meeting; at the meeting, students will sign a "contract" to promise to attend and participate regularly. Students will then attend all weekly meetings at a given time and day in a room provided by the school. Students can expect to collaborate with other participants, go on excurisions with the group to see what other groups are working on and accomplishing, make new friends inside and outside of school, and discover new subjects and areas of interest. Students will then gain the knowledge needed to further their own project(s) and will receive constructive feedback to finish and perfect their project(s). They can now use these experiences to share their finished project for schoolwide admiration and possible implementation.
